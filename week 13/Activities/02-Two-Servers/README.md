# **Instructions**

* Using the previous example as a guide, create an app that has two web servers.
* One that listens on port 7000 and one that listens on port 7500.
* The one listening on port 7000 will always tell the user something good about themselves.
* The one listening on 7500 will always tell the user something bad about themselves.
* Make sure you create a Github repo and commit this code!

**Bonus**

* Look for other ways to expand what your server can do. As possibilities:
  * Generate the good/bad phrase randomly from a list of predefined phrases
  * Use the `twitter` package inside the response to also return a random tweet
