# **Instructions**

* Implement the logic for the `WeatherAdmin` component. As with the `UserSearch` component, you should start with pseudocode.

  * This component requires you to read and save information. Be sure to `require` the appropriate Node package.

  * Create a `WeatherAdmin` constructor. This constructor should return an object with two methods.

  * One of those methods is `newUserSearch`, which should accept a user's `name` and `location`; search for the weather in their area; and save the user's information in a log of all searches users have made thus far.

  * The other method is `getData`, which should log or return a list of all of the searches users have executed thus far.

  * Test the `WeatherAdmin` component by feeding it dummy data for now.
