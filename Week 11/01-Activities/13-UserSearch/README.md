# **Instructions**

* Implement the logic for the `UserSearch` component. You should begin planning the component with pseudocode.

  * This component requires you to use the `weather-js` NPM package. Take a moment to research and experiment with the API, documented here:  <https://www.npmjs.com/package/weather-js>

  * Create a `UserSearch` constructor. It should accept a user's name and location as arguments, and store the value of `Date.now()` in a `date` property.

  * Objects returned by the `UserSearch` constructor should also have a `getWeather` method, which should log or return the weather in the user's location.

  * Test your UserSearch constructor by feeding it dummy data for now.
