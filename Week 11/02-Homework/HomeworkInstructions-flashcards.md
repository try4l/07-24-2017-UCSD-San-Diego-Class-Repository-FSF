# Advanced JavaScript Assignment: Constructor Flashcards

### Overview

In this week's assignment, you will create a flashcard command-line game using constructor functions.

## Instructions

The completed game should meet the following criteria:

1. The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.

2. Feel free to use as many different types of constructor functions as you are able to, but at a minimum, you must create the following constructor functions:

  * **Card**: Used to create an object representing a Flashcard. A Flashcard should consist of 2 sides, one representing the keyword/statement and the other the answer. For simplicity, it is recommended to make the answer side's value limited to a maximum of two words.

  * **Deck**: A collection of Flashcards used to manage the Flashcards.

  * **CliController**: The CLI Controller should start by listing the available Decks the user has and allow them to select a Deck to view the Flashcards. After a deck is selected, the CLI Controller should allow the user to perform 4 different actions:
    - 'answer' to check if they know the answer before flipping
    - 'flip' to see the other side of the Card
    - 'next' to move onto the next Card
    - 'exit' to end the game

3. You must keep track of the user's guesses and prompt the user if they would like to end the game if none remain

4. Each constructor function should be in it's own file and be exported and required wherever needed.

5. Look into [function prototypes](https://www.thecodeship.com/web-development/methods-within-constructor-vs-prototype-in-javascript/) and use them for a few of your constructor's methods.

### Notes

* Since this assignment is a command-line application, you don't need to deploy it anywhere. You will, however, be required to upload it to Github.

* Remember to include a `package.json` file containing your project dependencies in your Github repo!

### Minimum Requirements

Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed.
