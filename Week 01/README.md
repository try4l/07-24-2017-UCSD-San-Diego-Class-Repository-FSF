## Homework

#### DUE: Saturday, August 5th

This week you have the option of choosing between an Easy or Challenging Assignment.  If you aren't yet comfortable with positioning elements, I recommend you review the [activities](./Activities/) related to Floats and element Positioning.
The Recommended Assignment is aptly named, and we would prefer to see you challenge yourself with this task;  However if you feel like you need to dip your toes before jumping in, the Easier Assignment is a great way to get started.  It is not uncommon for students to complete the Easier Assignment before attempting the Recommended Assignment, but you may only submit one of them for grading.
Remember: You're here to learn a new trade, not to get an A+ on every homework - Don't avoid the struggle, embrace it!
