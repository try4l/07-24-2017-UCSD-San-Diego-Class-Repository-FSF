# Star Wars 01

## File

* `server1.js`

## Instructions

* Work with those around you to confirm your `server1.js` file working. This means figuring out: what dependencies to install, how to run the file, and how to view the resulting website in your browser. This step requires you to make ZERO changes to the code file. At this point, you are just getting the file you are given to run.

  * Then, once you've gotten the original code to display in browser add code to the file so that a new route for Obi-Wan Kenobi. Use the comments and the previous code in the file as a guide.

  * Help those around you when done.
