* Folder: `07-Browser-Automation`

* INSTRUCTIONS:

  * Make sure you've installed Nightmare locally: `npm install --save-dev nightmare` or `npm i -D nightmare`.

  * Refer to the Nightmare documentation here: <https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare#api>

  * Choose a site with which you're familiar. Write a few user stories for it.

  * Using the Nightmare documentation, try to implement a few of your user stories.

  * Take a look at the `screenshot` and `html` methods. Try to use them. Can you think of any use cases for these methods?

  * Be prepared to share your user stories with the class.

  * _Hint_: If you have trouble interacting with elements you expect to be on the page, try using `wait`. Don't forget to use your browser's dev tools to determine the correct element selectors! Use `06-Nightmare-Example` as a starting point if you feel overwhelmed.
