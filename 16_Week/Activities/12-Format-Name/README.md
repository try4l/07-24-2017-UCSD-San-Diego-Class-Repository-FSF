# Format Name

In this activity we will write a function that accepts an array of strings, and transforms it  into a formatted string. Then we will write tests for our function.

# Instructions

* Your task is to write a function that accepts an array of names and that produces the following kinds of output:

  * For `['Pushkin']`: `Pushkin`.

  * For `['Pushkin', 'Gogol']`: `Pushkin & Gogol`.

  * For `['Pushkin', 'Gogol', 'Zamyatin']`: `Pushkin, Gogol & Zamyatin`.

* With a partner, write unit tests against this behavior. Once you've described the function sufficiently, kick up a Karma server, and begin implementing the function.

* Do your tests completely describe the function? Be ready to explain why or why not.
