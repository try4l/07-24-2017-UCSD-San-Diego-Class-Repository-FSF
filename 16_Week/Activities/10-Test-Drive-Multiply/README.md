# Test Drive Multiply

In this activity we will write tests for the `multiply` function we worked with previously, and use Karma to watch our code as it is changed.

## Instructions

* Using your Karma setup, write tests for the `multiply` function we met in our last class. Make sure to test that it handles errors properly.

* After you've written tests describing the behavior of `multiply`, open a terminal and start Karma.

* In another terminal, write your implementation for `multiply`. Notice that Karma executes your tests every time you change your implementation.
