# Nightmare Tests Example

In this activity we will use nightmare to create automation tests for a live website.

## Instructions

* The purpose of this exercise is to get experience writing tests that specify how a site will behave.

* Choose a website with which you're familiar, and write a few user stories for it. Be sure not to write user stories against arbitrary features. Rather, write them such that taken together, they verify some of the site's primary functionality.

* Wrap those user stories in `describe` and `it` clauses.

* If you can get everything to pass, repeat the exercise for a different site.
