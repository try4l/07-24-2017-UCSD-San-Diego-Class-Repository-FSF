# Page Utilities

## Instructions

* Write a class that can do the following:

  * Keep track of how many blog posts a blog maintains on each page.

  * Keep track of how many blog posts the blog contains.

  * Determine how many posts are on page number `n`. It should behave sensibly if the blog does not have a page `n`.

* Before implementing any of this functionality, develop a test suite with your partner describing the desired behaviors.

### Hints 

* You'll have to come up with method names too. Write some code that uses the object you're about to create. What seem like natural choices for the object and for its methods' names?
